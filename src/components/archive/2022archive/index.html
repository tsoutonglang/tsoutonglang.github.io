                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm Tania Soutonglang, she/they. I'm a first generation Thai-American studying computer science with a minor in game studies and design at Illinois Institute of Technology.
                    I'm also a Girls Who Code Summer Immersion program alumni. In that program I created my first website with HTML and CSS, and learned the basics of Python. For my final project in the program, my group created a website and Scratch game to raise awareness about water pollution. </p>
                <p>I have a passion for creating stories with art, whether it is a simple illustration of a person sitting on at a cafe or a full comic about heartbreak. I have been an intern at Manga Art Studio since April 2020, a collective group of Chicago students where I work on improving my digital art and story telling skills.
                    Each week we have a weekly task to push our skills to create something new. We are also learning basics of animation including cleaning and coloring frames, and using that experience to create an upcoming original video animation.</p>
                <p>I have been using my experience and passion in art and programming to teach myself the language Ren'Py. I hope to create and release my own visual novel game based off of a story I made in high school. It is currently still in the storyline planning and character design stages, but I plan to gather a team of people who could help me with the writing, coding, and art.</p>
                <p>Currently I'm looking for internships that would help me gain more experience in software programming.</p>
